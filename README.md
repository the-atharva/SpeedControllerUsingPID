# SpeedControllerUsingPID
This repository has code for maintaining speed of DC motor under changing conditions achieved using PID controller\
This was made as my third year project required for partial fulfilment of credits.\
The project used a esp32 processor and a ir sensor used as tachometer. An amplifier is used to drive the motor & an optoisolator to isolate the control circuit and power circuit.\
The program also has code for visualising the speed of the motor in real time.\
The PID controller should be tuned for appropriate speed as required before operation.\
